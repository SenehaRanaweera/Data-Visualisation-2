NBN Co’s purpose is to lift the digital capability
of Australia and this drives the Company to
enable social and economic outcomes for
households, businesses, and communities
across the nation. Ubiquitous, fast and reliable
broadband supports a range of economic and
social benefits, that are essential to Australia’s
prosperity, such as remote access to essential
services which include healthcare and
education, and improved individual wellbeing.
The development of a Social Impact and
Value Measurement Framework was included
in the FY23/24 Sustainability Program. This
framework was developed in FY24 to better
measure and understand the social impacts
enabled by the nbn® network.

The framework was applied in FY24 to
measure the ‘so what’ of digital inclusion
for NBN Co’s customers, which is defined as
the social impact of the nbn® network on user
wellbeing (life satisfaction) across five outcome
domains:
• Employment and income
• Education and skills
• Health
• Social and community connection
• Environment.
